Copy the following files into your main game folder (the same folder containing the game's executable file):
- defaultargs.dll
- steam_api64.dll
- ThrowbackLoader.toml
- LaunchR6.bat

Next, copy the correct .dll file for your specific game season into the same folder:
- For seasons up to and including Y6S2 North Star: "uplay_r1_loader64.dll"
- For Y6S3 Crystal Guard: "upc_r1_loader64.dll"
- For Y6S4 High Calibre and later: "upc_r2_loader64.dll"

To change your username, edit the "ThrowbackLoader.toml" file.
To launch the game, double-click "LaunchR6.bat".
Your save files for each season will be stored in a "ThrowbackLoader" folder created within that season's game directory.
